Wrap your code in three backticks to post code into Discord chat. Activate syntax highlighting for Matlab code by adding "matlab" after the first three backticks.

E.g. typing:

\```matlab
for ii = 1:10
    disp(ii);
end%for ii
\```

Results in:
```matlab
for ii = 1:10
    disp(ii);
end%for ii
```
For longer code paste your m- and mat-files directly into chat or use <https://pastebin.com>.
